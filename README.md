# Red Team Projects

This repository is where I build and collect my own Red Team–related projects.  
The goal is to practice offensive security, networking, and tooling by creating small scripts and experiments.

## References / Sources
Some projects in this repo are inspired by or based on:

- **100 Red Team Projects** by kurogai  
  https://github.com/kurogai/100-redteam-projects

- Other external resources, documentation, and labs I use while learning.

More projects will be added as I continue learning.
